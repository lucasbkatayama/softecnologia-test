# Employee CRUD

Simple application that allows you to creade, update, remove, and read employees from an API.

The application was developed for the Developer Node React selection process of the company SOFTecnologia.

## Architecture

The architecture was based on the principles of SOLID and clean architecture. Containing 5 main layers:
- presentation (code that reflects in the visual interface, React is here)
- domain (interfaces that contain the application's use cases and models)
- data (implementation of domain interfaces with external libraries)
- main (starting point of the application and declaration and connection between the layers)

## Running the application

To run the application locally use the command:

```bash
  yarn dev
```
